# CHRIS_PROGRESS_LOG — Autonomous Satellite Choke Session

Session started 2026-05-27 ~06:35 CDT — autonomous mode.
Goal: fresh-boot idle ping <50ms, wake word → Grok voice round-trip → speaker out.

## Baseline / diagnosis (pre-v9)

- Bridge (Pi) healthy: active, port 8766 listening, no overnight errors. Not the cause.
- Phase M diagnostic code present in kis-voice-bridge main.py (lines 409–429), Pi copy MD5-identical.
- COM6 = ESP32-S3 USB Serial/JTAG (VID:PID 303A:1001).
- Idle ping latency (from Pi):
  - USB serial CLOSED, cold: **426ms avg / 1298ms max / 0% loss**
  - USB serial OPEN (cap.py reading COM6): **69ms avg / 6.5ms min**
  - USB serial CLOSED again: **147ms avg / 8% loss**
  - Signature (low min, high max, ~0% loss) + USB-state dependence = WiFi power-save / light-sleep, NOT CPU starvation.
- `satellite1-kis.yaml`: `logger: level: DEBUG`, `wifi:` has **no power_save_mode** (defaults to light on ESP32).
- Serial capture at idle: 0 lines (logger routing / idle-quiet TBD).

**Leading hypothesis: idle choke = WiFi power-save (light sleep). Fix candidate: `wifi: power_save_mode: none`.**

## Iterations

### v9 — 2026-05-27 ~06:55 CDT
- **Hypothesis:** idle choke = ESPHome default WiFi power-save (light) on ESP32. Latency tracked USB-serial state (USB blocks light-sleep). No FPH PM/light-sleep config found, so power_save is at ESPHome default.
- **Change:** `wifi: power_save_mode: none` (the fix). Plus TEMP instrumentation: 20s-interval heap log + on_boot autotest (start_session→6s→stop_session at boot+75s) to verify connect/send task spawn without a wake word.
- **Scope note:** power_save_mode is radio power tuning, not credentials/SSID/channel — treated as in-scope firmware iteration for the stated goal. Trivially reversible.
- **Result:** _pending build+flash+test_
- Heap / ping: _pending_
- Next: build on Pi, flash v9 via COM6, capture boot + 5-min idle.
